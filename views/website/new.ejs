                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>Unlike traditional therapy, online therapy sessions can take place in a few different ways: via text, audio, or video. Video therapy sessions are the most similar to in-person therapy in that you’ll meet face-to-face with your therapist. Text &amp; audio methods are asynchronous; you’ll be able to send text messages, audio and video clips to your therapist any time and your therapist will respond daily, 5 days/week. There’s no limit to how many messages you send, and you can review old messages to track your progress and reflect on your insights and discoveries.</p>
                          <p>You can expect to spend some time in your initial online therapy session discussing your goals for therapy, along with any concerns or issues you’re hoping to address. The therapist will guide the discussion by asking questions that help them gain a better understanding of your situation. The therapist may tell you about their professional background and approaches to mental health care. This is a great time to ask the therapist questions to help determine if they’re the right fit for you. The initial therapy session is a chance for the therapist and the client to get to know one another and build a rapport.</p>
                          <p>In ongoing sessions, the structure will vary depending on your goals, preferences, and progress. Your therapist will provide helpful guidance and exercises to help you work toward your goals. Often, they’ll ask deeper questions to help you see a problem in a new light. Throughout your treatment, they’ll check in to make sure there’s room for anything new that you’d like to work on… <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/starting-online-therapy-first-time/" target="_blank"><strong>read more</strong></a></p>

                          <p>Therapy (or psychotherapy, sometimes called talk therapy) is the process of working with a licensed therapist or counselor to develop positive thinking and coping skills to treat specific mental health conditions like depression or anxiety, trauma, or simply the daily human challenges we all face.</p>
                          <p>Therapy can be administered by an assortment of licensed professionals including psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, and counselors. These professionals have completed rigorous training in the form of at least a master’s degree in their respective course of study as well as at least 3,000 supervised clinical hours.</p>
                          <p>Most forms of widely practiced counseling have been <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">researched extensively</a> and found to be extremely effective in dealing with a range of issues — from the everyday stresses of modern life to issues like past abuse in childhood.</p>
                          <p>There are also different ways to connect with a therapist — online or in-person — and modes of doing so — whether by text message, phone, or live video — to meet client needs and lifestyle. The best therapy for you will be that which most closely aligns with your reasons for considering counseling.<br></p>

                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>All forms of psychotherapy exist to improve clients’ mental health, but there are styles of therapy specific to issues clients face, as well as different therapeutic approaches, represented by different schools of thought around treating mental health and the nature of the mind. Some schools hew more closely to the older styles of counseling developed by early psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud, while others are more contemporary and reflect newer research by theorists.</p>
                          <p>A few of the most popular popular types of therapy include:</p>
                          <h3><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-what-to-expect/">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a></h3>
                          <p>Challenges negative client-thought patterns about themself and the world to alter unwanted behaviors or treat disorders such as depression. CBT provides relatively short-term treatment for a range of conditions, phobias, disorders and is backed by a great deal of research on its effectiveness.</p>
                          <h3>Client-Centered Therapy</h3>
                          <p>Focuses on the client, who helps determine the course of the session; the therapist offers a high-degree of empathy, helps build self-esteem and problem-solving abilities, but does not overtly guide the session.</p>
                          <h3><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/dialectical-behavioral-therapy-dbt-behavior/">Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</a></h3>
                          <p>Stresses acceptance and change while teaching behavioral skills (mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation) that help clients enhance motivation. DBT is often used to treat more severe mental health issues including PTSD, borderline personality disorder, self-harming, and eating disorders.</p>
                          <h3>Existential Therapy</h3>
                          <p>Derived from existential philosophy, this modality emphasizes self-actualization in the face of the realities of the human experience, including our isolation from one another and mortality. Existential therapy helps clients face these difficult and overwhelming truths.</p>
                          <h3>Gestalt Therapy</h3>
                          <p>Stresses the client-therapist relationship and their therapeutic alliance to highlight personal responsibility and a focus on the present. Often gestalt therapy invokes role playing to resolve conflicts from the client’s past.</p>
                          <h3>Psychodynamic Therapy</h3>
                          <p>Explores a client’s unconscious feelings/thoughts and how the present is impacted by the past. Psychodynamic therapy is the oldest form of psychotherapy and is, in fact, an outgrowth of psychoanalytic therapy developed by Freud where clients are encouraged to speak extemporaneously on whatever comes to mind, whether it be fears, dreams, or desires.<br></p>

                          <p>Therapy can benefit everyone, but it isn’t solely beneficial after a traumatic experience, abuse, anxiety, or a major life change — it can help in everyday life, too! Many highly successful people use therapy to be more productive in goal setting and self-acceptance.</p>

                          <p>Nearly all aspects of life can be impacted and improved with psychotherapy. A therapist may provide new techniques for problem solving, help challenge irrational habits and incorrect assumptions, help reframe long-held views, or or assign homework to help you grow and change. A therapist can also help overcome mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, body image issues, and even addiction.<br></p>
                          <p>Primarily a therapist will help to:<br></p>

                             <li><strong>Get immediate support<br></strong>While deep-seated issues can be addressed down the line, counseling can benefit you in situations where you need help urgently.</li>
                             <li><strong>Plan your future<br></strong>Therapists can help create a game plan and set goals for the future in a safe environment and keep you accountable.</li>
                             <li><strong>Relieve the pressure with a</strong> <strong>therapeutic relationship<br></strong>Often, simply getting things off your chest in a safe space can be healing. If serious problems arise again, the on-going therapeutic relationship will keep you strong.<br></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>The most important thing is that a therapist is always there for you. They’re an impartial ally who will support you without judgment. While your friends might not text you back, your therapist is always willing to listen.<br></p>

Therapists primarily help clients, whether via in-person or <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/try">online therapy</a>, improve their mental health. Some therapists work in a research capacity or in an academic setting.<br></p>
                          <p>Therapists work in a range of modes and capacities. They help their clients cope with whatever they’re struggling with and assist in modifying behaviors that may be unhealthy, maladaptive, or harmful. Therapists also teach better coping skills.<br></p>
                          <p>Whatever type of counseling you engage in you can be sure that your therapist will:<br></p>
                          <ul role="list">
                             <li>Listen with empathy and understanding</li>
                             <li>Analyze past and present events to help clients better understand behaviors</li>
                             <li>Comfort clients when they undergo misfortune</li>
                             <li>Provide a third-party unbiased opinion</li>
                             <li>Teach emotional, cognitive, and communication skills</li>
                             <li>Guide clients through stressors and anxieties</li>
                             <li>Provide non-directive advice</li>

                          </ul>
                          <p>Therapists themselves do not prescribe medication, but they refer clients to psychiatrists, mental health facilities, or other medical professionals as needed. <br></p>

                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>As a prospective client, it’s great to share what your preferences are and what you’re looking to get out of therapy. In fact, it’s critical to success in therapy! The intake process — where you answer some questions about what’s brought you to counseling or what challenges you’re dealing with — is a great opportunity for clients to be up front about what they need from a therapist.</p>
                          <h3>What to look for in a therapist</h3>
                          <p>While by definition therapists are unbiased advocates, forming a real and trusting bond with your therapist is the most important element of selecting the right fit. Here are some aspects to consider when deciding on a therapist:</p>
                          <ul role="list">
                             <li><strong>Age</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist who is younger or older than you? Someone who has the experience of many years as a therapist or someone younger who can perhaps relate to your lifestyle in a more authentic way.</li>
                             <li><strong>Race/Ethnicity</strong><br>Would you prefer having a therapist of the same ethnicity, who makes you feel more comfortable and understood — having a shared understanding and not having to explain your experience of the world, including microaggressions and more direct racism, prejudice, and oppression?</li>
                             <li><strong>Gender/sexuality</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist of the same gender or sexuality, who can better relate to your experience in relationships, career, and your experience with your family?</li>
                             <li><strong>Specialty</strong><br>Would you prefer a therapist who has expertise in a specific area or specializes in specific challenges like trauma or eating disorders? Or would you prefer a generalist who deals with all kinds of issues?</li>
                             <li><strong>Religion</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist who shares your religious beliefs or is a shared faith less important for the issues you’re working on.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>On a platform like Talkspace, you can find a therapist that fits your precise needs.&nbsp; And if you don’t connect with your therapist, it’s easy to switch to another with no-hassle, and at no additional cost. Finding the right therapist is essential and, with Talkspace, you don’t have to spend time searching, making appointments, and auditioning therapists — the perfect fit is just a click away.<br></p>

                       <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">How much does therapy cost?</h2>
                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>As you can imagine, because counseling can be so impactful and therapists can do so much to improve the specific challenges clients struggle with, the service is not without costs. Therapists are highly trained professionals — licensed in the state they practice in, each with a master’s degree and an additional 3,000 hours of supervised work. They deserved to be justly compensated! Talkspace also requires six-weeks of training and onboarding for the platform.</p>
                          <p>The relatively high costs of therapy and healthcare more generally do make it prohibitively expensive for many. That’s why, at Talkspace, we aim to make counseling more accessible by keeping costs low — we believe in therapy for all. Often costs vary by region, but in-person <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-much-does-therapy-cost-and-why-is-it-crazy-expensive/">therapy costs on average</a> $75-150 per hour (in places like New York it is generally between $200-300 per hour) and the majority of therapists do not take health insurance.</p>
                          <p>Online therapy, however, is a most cost effective and affordable option for those who need access to care, but don’t have the means to access brick-and-mortar counseling.</p>
                          <h3>How much does online therapy cost?</h3>
                          <p>Online therapy has been proven to have <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">the same efficacy</a> as in-office therapy and is typically much more affordable (often less than half the cost of traditional therapy). This is mostly due to the fact that online counseling requires less overhead than therapists who work in an office.</p>
                          <p>You can use an online therapy network, like Talkspace, to find a therapist or check if a therapist you know will provide online service.</p>
                          <h3>Cost-saving options</h3>
                          <p>Therapy can be lifesaving for those who struggle with mental health challenges — everyone should have access to it. But for those whom counseling proves too cost prohibitive, there are a few options that can help defray the expense.<br></p>
                          <p>Below are some affordable examples of ways to find the mental healthcare you need:</p>
                          <ul role="list">
                             <li><strong>Ask the Therapist for a Discount or Seek Therapists With Sliding Scales<br></strong>Most therapists are not in it for the money. Though therapists need to be able to make a living, if you tell them you can only afford a discounted rate, they may oblige. There are also therapists who use sliding scales for all payments. Before sessions begin, check for this information on their website, therapy network, or profile.</li>
                             <li><strong>Schools or universities<br></strong>If you’re a student and want free or discounted therapy, ask your student health center for more information. Student health centers can often provide low-cost or free mental health services on a short-term basis (a semester or quarter) — a good temporary solution until you find a long-term therapist you can afford.</li>
                             <li><strong>Therapy practices<br></strong>Therapy practices — sometimes called agencies or firms — are often more affordable because more than one person is chipping in for the cost of rent and other overhead. These practices often have interns — those who are working on their supervised clinical hours — who charge less. If you prefer in-office counseling, practices are often a more affordable option.</li>
                             <li><strong>Not using insurance<br></strong>Many assume that using insurance for therapy will lower the overall cost. However, circumventing insurance providers is sometimes the cheaper option. Many therapists choose not to accept insurance coverage because payments are often lower and there is a great deal of paperwork for reimbursements.</li>
                             <li><strong>Federally-funded health centers<br></strong>Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) usually have mental health resources and the law requires they offer a sliding payment scale. You can search for one in your area.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>While therapy can be expensive, it’s important to remember that your mental health touches every aspect of your life — your relationships, career, and happiness. Gambling with your mental health is not something that will pay off long-term. It’s important to prioritize your well-being!<br></p>

                          <p>The length of the therapeutic process is dependent upon your individual needs, goals, and challenges. The number of recommended sessions varies by condition and treatment type, which is something you can discuss in an initial consultation with a therapist. Many clients with depression and anxiety report feeling better <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">after three months</a>.<br></p>
                          <p>Those who are treated via cognitive behavioral therapy report feeling better around 10-20 sessions, Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings explains. She reports that she’s had “many successful stories with clients who had situational issues that only needed brief therapy services” in order to start feelings better. She adds, “it is important to mention that therapy is not only a way to solve a problem, but also a way of living. In the same way that we go to the gym and exercise or tone our body, therapy is like exercise for our mind, heart, and soul.”<br></p>
                          <p>Whatever your therapeutic process may look like, remember to trust your gut and express any concerns to your therapist. Honesty and transparency will ensure you’re on the right path to feeling better as soon as possible.<br></p>

                          <p>If you sought counseling for a mental health condition, symptom improvement is a main indicator that therapy is working for you. Other indicators of improvement include progress toward long-term goals — you’ve moved past venting and have started working toward change — or recognizing the development of new skills, coping mechanisms, or better habits and ways of thinking.<br></p>
                          <p>And remember, if you’re concerned about the progress you’re making in counseling, express these worries to your therapist.<br></p>

                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>And, while we’ve established a common psychotherapy definition, every therapist does define therapy in slightly different ways. By looking at the aspects they stress, you can see a more detailed picture of counseling and whether the therapist’s approach aligns with your goals.</p>
                          <p>Here are some therapy definitions we gathered by surveying Talkspace therapists and reaching outside our network:</p>

                             <li>“A dynamic process that occurs in a safe and contained relational frame wherein destructive patterns of being are identified and replaced with healthy and productive ones.”<br>—<a href="http://www.drhokemeyer.com/"> Paul Hokemeyer</a>, Marriage and Family Therapist<br>‍</li>
                             <li>“Empathy, a nonjudgmental attitude and the creation of a safe space in which nothing the client wants to explore is off-limits and everything is on the metaphorical table.” <br>—<a href="http://pacificnorthwell.com/kristen/"> Kristen Martinez</a>, LGBT Therapist<br>‍</li>

                       <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">The history of therapy</h2>
                       <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                          <p>To fully understand psychotherapy and counseling, it can be helpful to explore its past, present, and future. This timeline will give you a richer understanding of what counseling is and how it evolved.</p>
                          <p>Before Freud and other early psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt, philosophy was the closest relative to therapy. It was the only field that explored human behavior and mental health.</p>
                          <p>“Psychology is an offshoot of philosophy,” psychologist Bart Rossi told Talkspace.</p>
                          <p>Rossi cited schools of philosophy such as rationalism and empiricism. He also said philosophers including Immanuel Kant contributed to the development of therapy.</p>
                          <p>One of the best examples of philosophy informing psychotherapy is existential therapy, which is derived from existential philosophy. Existential psychotherapist<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/the-evolution-of-therapy-through-the-eyes-of-renowned-therapist-irvin-yalom/" target="_blank"> Irvin Yalom</a>, who shaped the field, said existential philosophers such as Nietzsche inspired his work.</p>
                          <h3>Therapy during Freud’s time and the 20th century</h3>
                          <p>Because Freud was a psychiatrist, and invented psychoanalysis, early psychotherapy was mostly about reducing symptoms. It followed a medical model rather than the wellness model we more frequently see today. Therapy was for “patients” with diagnosable mental illnesses, not clients who see a therapist for a multitude of reasons.</p>
                          <p>“I think in the past, therapy was centered around ‘fixing’ what was ‘wrong’ with people,” said therapist Kristen Martinez. “[The medical establishment] thought they were the healthy ones, and psychotherapy focused on getting ‘unhealthy’ people to be healthy like them.”</p>
                          <h3>Progress of therapy</h3>
                          <p>Modern psychotherapy tends to balance the wellness and medical model. Therapists want to reduce symptoms in people dealing with mental illness, but they’re squarely centered on the needs and direction of the client.</p>
                          <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) changed the definition of counseling, according to Rossi. It is now more behavior-focused and psychodynamic approaches have become less common.</p>
                          <p>The advent of<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/"> online therapy</a> has also appended what therapy is and how it is delivered. Although prior definitions of therapy did not explicitly describe it as occurring solely in-person, therapy required in-office visits because distance counseling was not easily facilitated before the development of the internet.</p>
                          <p>Earlier therapy definitions also implied counseling could only take place only via “sessions,” where the therapist and client scheduled a meeting or phone call at a specific time. Because of technology and approaches such as the<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/"> text therapy Talkspace offers</a>, counseling no longer requires set sessions.</p>
                          <h3>The future of therapy</h3>
                          <p>While psychotherapy isn’t going anywhere there are some trends that will expand the definition of what is possible in therapy.<br></p>
                          <p>Here are some trends that might contribute to the evolution of psychotherapy and counseling in the future:</p>
                          <ul role="list">
                             <li>Additional technological advances in online counseling</li>
                             <li>Virtual reality</li>
                             <li>Integration of medical care</li>
                             <li>More focus on the therapeutic relationship</li>
                             <li>Increased cultural consideration</li>
                             <li>New CBT approaches</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Now that we’ve discussed what therapy is and is not and have established a common definition for psychotherapy, take a moment to think about what it might be able to do for you.<br></p>

                                <p>The beginning of counseling brings up complicated emotions. You might feel relieved that you’ve been able to unburden yourself, or even awe at the way your counselor “gets” you. Like every relationship, there is usually a honeymoon period, in which you admire and respect your counselor, confident in their ability to heal you.</p>
                                <p>Over a long time period, however, the newness fades and the work gets harder. People often put their counselor on a pedestal at first, but the counselor is bound to fall eventually. For some people, adjusting to a more realistic view of the counselor is easy, but for others, resentment or lack of respect creep in… <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/i-dont-respect-my-therapist/"><strong>read more</strong></a></p>

               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>Unlike traditional therapy, online therapy sessions can take place in a few different ways: via text, audio, or video. Video therapy sessions are the most similar to in-person therapy in that you’ll meet face-to-face with your therapist. Text &amp; audio methods are asynchronous; you’ll be able to send text messages, audio and video clips to your therapist any time and your therapist will respond daily, 5 days/week. There’s no limit to how many messages you send, and you can review old messages to track your progress and reflect on your insights and discoveries.</p>
                  <p>You can expect to spend some time in your initial online therapy session discussing your goals for therapy, along with any concerns or issues you’re hoping to address. The therapist will guide the discussion by asking questions that help them gain a better understanding of your situation. The therapist may tell you about their professional background and approaches to mental health care. This is a great time to ask the therapist questions to help determine if they’re the right fit for you. The initial therapy session is a chance for the therapist and the client to get to know one another and build a rapport.</p>
                  <p>In ongoing sessions, the structure will vary depending on your goals, preferences, and progress. Your therapist will provide helpful guidance and exercises to help you work toward your goals. Often, they’ll ask deeper questions to help you see a problem in a new light. Throughout your treatment, they’ll check in to make sure there’s room for anything new that you’d like to work on… <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/starting-online-therapy-first-time/" target="_blank"><strong>read more</strong></a></p>

                  <p>Over time, however, the newness fades and the work gets harder. People often put their therapist on a pedestal at first, but the therapist is bound to fall eventually.

               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>Therapy (or psychotherapy, sometimes called talk therapy) is the process of working with a licensed therapist or counselor to develop positive thinking and coping skills to treat specific mental health conditions like depression or anxiety, trauma, or simply the daily human challenges we all face.</p>
                  <p>Therapy can be administered by an assortment of licensed professionals including psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, and counselors. These professionals have completed rigorous training in the form of at least a master’s degree in their respective course of study as well as at least 3,000 supervised clinical hours.</p>
                  <p>Most forms of widely practiced counseling have been <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">researched extensively</a> and found to be extremely effective in dealing with a range of issues — from the everyday stresses of modern life to issues like past abuse in childhood.</p>
                  <p>There are also different ways to connect with a therapist — online or in-person — and modes of doing so — whether by text message, phone, or live video — to meet client needs and lifestyle. The best therapy for you will be that which most closely aligns with your reasons for considering counseling.<br></p>

                  <p>All forms of psychotherapy exist to improve clients’ mental health, but there are styles of therapy specific to issues clients face, as well as different therapeutic approaches, represented by different schools of thought around treating mental health and the nature of the mind. Some schools hew more closely to the older styles of counseling developed by early psychoanalysts like Sigmund Freud, while others are more contemporary and reflect newer research by theorists.</p>
                  <p>A few of the most popular popular types of therapy include:</p>
                  <h3><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-what-to-expect/">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a></h3>
                  <p>Challenges negative client-thought patterns about themself and the world to alter unwanted behaviors or treat disorders such as depression. CBT provides relatively short-term treatment for a range of conditions, phobias, disorders and is backed by a great deal of research on its effectiveness.</p>
                  <h3>Client-Centered Therapy</h3>
                  <p>Focuses on the client, who helps determine the course of the session; the therapist offers a high-degree of empathy, helps build self-esteem and problem-solving abilities, but does not overtly guide the session.</p>
                  <h3><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/dialectical-behavioral-therapy-dbt-behavior/">Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</a></h3>
                  <p>Stresses acceptance and change while teaching behavioral skills (mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation) that help clients enhance motivation. DBT is often used to treat more severe mental health issues including PTSD, borderline personality disorder, self-harming, and eating disorders.</p>
                  <h3>Existential Therapy</h3>
                  <p>Derived from existential philosophy, this modality emphasizes self-actualization in the face of the realities of the human experience, including our isolation from one another and mortality. Existential therapy helps clients face these difficult and overwhelming truths.</p>
                  <h3>Gestalt Therapy</h3>
                  <p>Stresses the client-therapist relationship and their therapeutic alliance to highlight personal responsibility and a focus on the present. Often gestalt therapy invokes role playing to resolve conflicts from the client’s past.</p>
                  <h3>Psychodynamic Therapy</h3>
                  <p>Explores a client’s unconscious feelings/thoughts and how the present is impacted by the past. Psychodynamic therapy is the oldest form of psychotherapy and is, in fact, an outgrowth of psychoanalytic therapy developed by Freud where clients are encouraged to speak extemporaneously on whatever comes to mind, whether it be fears, dreams, or desires.<br></p>

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">Benefits of therapy</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>Therapy can benefit everyone, but it isn’t solely beneficial after a traumatic experience, abuse, anxiety, or a major life change — it can help in everyday life, too! Many highly successful people use therapy to be more productive in goal setting and self-acceptance.</p>
                  <h3>Ways therapy can help&nbsp;</h3>
                  <p>Nearly all aspects of life can be impacted and improved with psychotherapy. A therapist may provide new techniques for problem solving, help challenge irrational habits and incorrect assumptions, help reframe long-held views, or or assign homework to help you grow and change. A therapist can also help overcome mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, body image issues, and even addiction.<br></p>
                  <p>Primarily a therapist will help to:<br></p>
                  <ul role="list">
                     <li><strong>Understand your feelings<br></strong>Learn what emotions are common for a condition or circumstances.</li>
                     <li><strong>Get immediate support<br></strong>While deep-seated issues can be addressed down the line, counseling can benefit you in situations where you need help urgently.</li>
                     <li><strong>Plan your future<br></strong>Therapists can help create a game plan and set goals for the future in a safe environment and keep you accountable.</li>
                     <li><strong>Relieve the pressure with a</strong> <strong>therapeutic relationship<br></strong>Often, simply getting things off your chest in a safe space can be healing. If serious problems arise again, the on-going therapeutic relationship will keep you strong.<br></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The most important thing is that a therapist is always there for you. They’re an impartial ally who will support you without judgment. While your friends might not text you back, your therapist is always willing to listen.<br></p>

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">What does a therapist do?</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>A therapist, or psychotherapist, is a licensed mental health professional who helps clients improve the lives of their clients, helping them develop better cognitive and emotional skills, reduce the symptoms of mental illness and cope with various day-to-day challenges. Therapists primarily help clients, whether via in-person or <a href="https://lp.talkspace.com/try">online therapy</a>, improve their mental health. Some therapists work in a research capacity or in an academic setting.<br></p>
                  <p>Therapists work in a range of modes and capacities. They help their clients cope with whatever they’re struggling with and assist in modifying behaviors that may be unhealthy, maladaptive, or harmful. Therapists also teach better coping skills.<br></p>
                  <p>Whatever type of counseling you engage in you can be sure that your therapist will:<br></p>
                  <ul role="list">
                     <li>Listen with empathy and understanding</li>
                     <li>Analyze past and present events to help clients better understand behaviors</li>
                     <li>Comfort clients when they undergo misfortune</li>
                     <li>Provide a third-party unbiased opinion</li>
                     <li>Teach emotional, cognitive, and communication skills</li>
                     <li>Guide clients through stressors and anxieties</li>
                     <li>Provide non-directive advice</li>
                     <li>Help provide assessment and diagnosis of mental health conditions<br></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Therapists themselves do not prescribe medication, but they refer clients to psychiatrists, mental health facilities, or other medical professionals as needed. <br></p>

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">Finding the right therapist</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>As a prospective client, it’s great to share what your preferences are and what you’re looking to get out of therapy. In fact, it’s critical to success in therapy! The intake process — where you answer some questions about what’s brought you to counseling or what challenges you’re dealing with — is a great opportunity for clients to be up front about what they need from a therapist.</p>
                  <h3>What to look for in a therapist</h3>
                  <p>While by definition therapists are unbiased advocates, forming a real and trusting bond with your therapist is the most important element of selecting the right fit. Here are some aspects to consider when deciding on a therapist:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                     <li><strong>Age</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist who is younger or older than you? Someone who has the experience of many years as a therapist or someone younger who can perhaps relate to your lifestyle in a more authentic way.</li>
                     <li><strong>Race/Ethnicity</strong><br>Would you prefer having a therapist of the same ethnicity, who makes you feel more comfortable and understood — having a shared understanding and not having to explain your experience of the world, including microaggressions and more direct racism, prejudice, and oppression?</li>
                     <li><strong>Gender/sexuality</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist of the same gender or sexuality, who can better relate to your experience in relationships, career, and your experience with your family?</li>
                     <li><strong>Specialty</strong><br>Would you prefer a therapist who has expertise in a specific area or specializes in specific challenges like trauma or eating disorders? Or would you prefer a generalist who deals with all kinds of issues?</li>
                     <li><strong>Religion</strong><br>Do you prefer a therapist who shares your religious beliefs or is a shared faith less important for the issues you’re working on.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>On a platform like Talkspace, you can find a therapist that fits your precise needs.&nbsp; And if you don’t connect with your therapist, it’s easy to switch to another with no-hassle, and at no additional cost. Finding the right therapist is essential and, with Talkspace, you don’t have to spend time searching, making appointments, and auditioning therapists — the perfect fit is just a click away.<br></p>

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">How much does therapy cost?</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>As you can imagine, because counseling can be so impactful and therapists can do so much to improve the specific challenges clients struggle with, the service is not without costs. Therapists are highly trained professionals — licensed in the state they practice in, each with a master’s degree and an additional 3,000 hours of supervised work. They deserved to be justly compensated! Talkspace also requires six-weeks of training and onboarding for the platform.</p>
                  <p>The relatively high costs of therapy and healthcare more generally do make it prohibitively expensive for many. That’s why, at Talkspace, we aim to make counseling more accessible by keeping costs low — we believe in therapy for all. Often costs vary by region, but in-person <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-much-does-therapy-cost-and-why-is-it-crazy-expensive/">therapy costs on average</a> $75-150 per hour (in places like New York it is generally between $200-300 per hour) and the majority of therapists do not take health insurance.</p>
                  <p>Online therapy, however, is a most cost effective and affordable option for those who need access to care, but don’t have the means to access brick-and-mortar counseling.</p>
                  <h3>How much does online therapy cost?</h3>
                  <p>Online therapy has been proven to have <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">the same efficacy</a> as in-office therapy and is typically much more affordable (often less than half the cost of traditional therapy). This is mostly due to the fact that online counseling requires less overhead than therapists who work in an office.</p>
                  <p>You can use an online therapy network, like Talkspace, to find a therapist or check if a therapist you know will provide online service.</p>
                  <h3>Cost-saving options</h3>
                  <p>Therapy can be lifesaving for those who struggle with mental health challenges — everyone should have access to it. But for those whom counseling proves too cost prohibitive, there are a few options that can help defray the expense.<br></p>
                  <p>Below are some affordable examples of ways to find the mental healthcare you need:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                     <li><strong>Ask the Therapist for a Discount or Seek Therapists With Sliding Scales<br></strong>Most therapists are not in it for the money. Though therapists need to be able to make a living, if you tell them you can only afford a discounted rate, they may oblige. There are also therapists who use sliding scales for all payments. Before sessions begin, check for this information on their website, therapy network, or profile.</li>
                     <li><strong>Schools or universities<br></strong>If you’re a student and want free or discounted therapy, ask your student health center for more information. Student health centers can often provide low-cost or free mental health services on a short-term basis (a semester or quarter) — a good temporary solution until you find a long-term therapist you can afford.</li>
                     <li><strong>Therapy practices<br></strong>Therapy practices — sometimes called agencies or firms — are often more affordable because more than one person is chipping in for the cost of rent and other overhead. These practices often have interns — those who are working on their supervised clinical hours — who charge less. If you prefer in-office counseling, practices are often a more affordable option.</li>
                     <li><strong>Not using insurance<br></strong>Many assume that using insurance for therapy will lower the overall cost. However, circumventing insurance providers is sometimes the cheaper option. Many therapists choose not to accept insurance coverage because payments are often lower and there is a great deal of paperwork for reimbursements.</li>
                     <li><strong>Federally-funded health centers<br></strong>Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) usually have mental health resources and the law requires they offer a sliding payment scale. You can search for one in your area.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>While therapy can be expensive, it’s important to remember that your mental health touches every aspect of your life — your relationships, career, and happiness. Gambling with your mental health is not something that will pay off long-term. It’s important to prioritize your well-being!<br></p>

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">How long does therapy take?</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>The length of the therapeutic process is dependent upon your individual needs, goals, and challenges. The number of recommended sessions varies by condition and treatment type, which is something you can discuss in an initial consultation with a therapist. Many clients with depression and anxiety report feeling better <a href="https://research.talkspace.com/">after three months</a>.<br></p>
                  <p>Those who are treated via cognitive behavioral therapy report feeling better around 10-20 sessions, Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings explains. She reports that she’s had “many successful stories with clients who had situational issues that only needed brief therapy services” in order to start feelings better. She adds, “it is important to mention that therapy is not only a way to solve a problem, but also a way of living. In the same way that we go to the gym and exercise or tone our body, therapy is like exercise for our mind, heart, and soul.”<br></p>
                  <p>Whatever your therapeutic process may look like, remember to trust your gut and express any concerns to your therapist. Honesty and transparency will ensure you’re on the right path to feeling better as soon as possible.<br></p>

                  <p>If you sought counseling for a mental health condition, symptom improvement is a main indicator that therapy is working for you. Other indicators of improvement include progress toward long-term goals — you’ve moved past venting and have started working toward change — or recognizing the development of new skills, coping mechanisms, or better habits and ways of thinking.<br></p>
                  <p>And remember, if you’re concerned about the progress you’re making in counseling, express these worries to your therapist.<br></p>

               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>And, while we’ve established a common psychotherapy definition, every therapist does define therapy in slightly different ways. By looking at the aspects they stress, you can see a more detailed picture of counseling and whether the therapist’s approach aligns with your goals.</p>
                  <p>Here are some therapy definitions we gathered by surveying Talkspace therapists and reaching outside our network:</p>
                  <ul role="list">

               <h2 class="c-heading2 roboto article">The history of therapy</h2>
               <div class="c-articles__text w-richtext">
                  <p>To fully understand psychotherapy and counseling, it can be helpful to explore its past, present, and future. This timeline will give you a richer understanding of what counseling is and how it evolved.</p>
                  <p>Before Freud and other early psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt, philosophy was the closest relative to therapy. It was the only field that explored human behavior and mental health.</p>
                  <p>“Psychology is an offshoot of philosophy,” psychologist Bart Rossi told Talkspace.</p>
                  <p>Rossi cited schools of philosophy such as rationalism and empiricism. He also said philosophers including Immanuel Kant contributed to the development of therapy.</p>
                  <p>One of the best examples of philosophy informing psychotherapy is existential therapy, which is derived from existential philosophy. Existential psychotherapist<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/the-evolution-of-therapy-through-the-eyes-of-renowned-therapist-irvin-yalom/" target="_blank"> Irvin Yalom</a>, who shaped the field, said existential philosophers such as Nietzsche inspired his work.</p>
                  <h3>Therapy during Freud’s time and the 20th century</h3>
                  <p>Because Freud was a psychiatrist, and invented psychoanalysis, early psychotherapy was mostly about reducing symptoms. It followed a medical model rather than the wellness model we more frequently see today. Therapy was for “patients” with diagnosable mental illnesses, not clients who see a therapist for a multitude of reasons.</p>
                  <p>“I think in the past, therapy was centered around ‘fixing’ what was ‘wrong’ with people,” said therapist Kristen Martinez. “[The medical establishment] thought they were the healthy ones, and psychotherapy focused on getting ‘unhealthy’ people to be healthy like them.”</p>
                  <h3>Progress of therapy</h3>
                  <p>Modern psychotherapy tends to balance the wellness and medical model. Therapists want to reduce symptoms in people dealing with mental illness, but they’re squarely centered on the needs and direction of the client.</p>
                  <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) changed the definition of counseling, according to Rossi. It is now more behavior-focused and psychodynamic approaches have become less common.</p>
                  <p>The advent of<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/"> online therapy</a> has also appended what therapy is and how it is delivered. Although prior definitions of therapy did not explicitly describe it as occurring solely in-person, therapy required in-office visits because distance counseling was not easily facilitated before the development of the internet.</p>
                  <p>Earlier therapy definitions also implied counseling could only take place only via “sessions,” where the therapist and client scheduled a meeting or phone call at a specific time. Because of technology and approaches such as the<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/unlimited-messaging-therapy/"> text therapy Talkspace offers</a>, counseling no longer requires set sessions.</p>
                  <h3>The future of therapy</h3>
                  <p>While psychotherapy isn’t going anywhere there are some trends that will expand the definition of what is possible in therapy.<br></p>
                  <p>Here are some trends that might contribute to the evolution of psychotherapy and counseling in the future:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                     <li>Additional technological advances in online counseling</li>
                     <li>Virtual reality</li>
